# User Routes Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented and tested a comprehensive user authentication and management system for the ANRS (Balanced Diet Recommendation System) backend.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. User Model (`backend/models/User.js`)
- Complete User class with CRUD operations
- Password hashing using bcryptjs
- Email validation and uniqueness checks
- Profile management methods
- Safe JSON serialization (excludes password hash)
- User statistics and pagination support

### 2. Authentication Routes (`backend/routes/auth.js`)
- **POST /api/auth/register** - User registration with validation
- **POST /api/auth/login** - User login with password verification
- **GET /api/auth/verify** - JWT token verification
- **GET /api/auth/profile** - Get authenticated user profile
- Rate limiting for security (5 requests per 15 minutes)
- Comprehensive input validation using express-validator

### 3. User Management Routes (`backend/routes/users.js`)
- **GET /api/users/profile** - Get current user profile
- **PUT /api/users/profile** - Update user profile (name, email)
- **PUT /api/users/password** - Change user password
- **GET /api/users/activities** - Get user activities with pagination
- **GET /api/users/stats** - Get user statistics (saved meals, budget history, etc.)
- **DELETE /api/users/account** - Delete user account (requires password confirmation)
- All routes protected with authentication middleware

### 4. Test Scripts
- **test-user-auth.js** - Authentication system tests
- **test-user-routes.js** - User routes functionality tests
- **test-user-system.js** - Comprehensive integration tests
- **simple-user-test.js** - Basic functionality verification

## Features Implemented

### Security Features
- JWT token-based authentication
- Password hashing with bcryptjs (12 salt rounds)
- Rate limiting on authentication endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protected routes requiring valid authentication
- Token type verification (user vs admin tokens)

### User Management
- User registration with email uniqueness validation
- Secure login with password verification
- Profile updates with email conflict checking
- Password change with current password verification
- Account deletion with password confirmation
- User activity tracking capability
- User statistics aggregation

### API Response Format
All endpoints follow a consistent response format:
```json
{
  "success": true/false,
  "message": "Description",
  "data": {...},
  "errors": [...] // for validation errors
}
```

## Database Schema
Uses existing `users` table with the following structure:
- `id` - Auto-increment primary key
- `name` - User's full name
- `email` - Unique email address
- `password_hash` - Bcrypt hashed password
- `role` - User role (default: 'user')
- `is_active` - Account status
- `created_at` - Account creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last update timestamp

## Testing Results

### âœ… Successful Tests
1. **User Registration** - Creates new users with proper validation
2. **User Login** - Authenticates users and returns JWT tokens
3. **Token Verification** - Validates JWT tokens correctly
4. **Profile Management** - Get and update user profiles
5. **Password Changes** - Secure password updates
6. **User Statistics** - Retrieves user activity statistics
7. **Authentication Protection** - Routes properly protected
8. **Input Validation** - Rejects invalid data with proper error messages
9. **Rate Limiting** - Prevents abuse with request limiting
10. **Error Handling** - Proper error responses for various scenarios

### Manual Testing Verification
```bash
# Server health check
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/health

# User registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Test User","email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123"}'

# User login
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"TestPass123"}'

# Get user profile (with token)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE"

# Update user profile
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/users/profile \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Updated Name","email":"test@example.com"}'
```

## Package Dependencies Added
- `axios` (dev dependency) - For testing HTTP requests

## NPM Scripts Added
- `npm run test-user-auth` - Run authentication tests
- `npm run test-user-routes` - Run user routes tests
- `npm run test-user-system` - Run comprehensive test suite

## Integration with Existing System
- Uses existing database configuration (`mysql-database.js`)
- Integrates with existing authentication middleware (`auth.js`)
- Follows existing code patterns and conventions
- Compatible with existing admin authentication system
- Uses existing server configuration and middleware

## Security Considerations
- Passwords are never stored in plain text
- JWT tokens include user type verification
- Rate limiting prevents brute force attacks
- Input validation prevents injection attacks
- Authentication required for all user operations
- Password confirmation required for account deletion

## Next Steps
The user authentication and management system is now fully functional and ready for production use. The system provides:
- Secure user registration and login
- Complete profile management
- Activity tracking capabilities
- Comprehensive testing coverage
- Production-ready security features

All endpoints are working correctly and have been thoroughly tested both programmatically and manually.
